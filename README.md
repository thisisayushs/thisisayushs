# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, Iâ€™m Ayush.
- Iâ€™m an Artifical Intelligence grad, now a learner at Apple Developer Academy @UNINA Federico II.
- Solving real-world challenges using technology is my thing.

## ðŸ‘€ Core Focus Areas:
- Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning - Iâ€™ve worked on Apple platform apps that tap into cutting-edge AI/ML frameworks like CreateML, CoreML, and Natural Language.
- Spatial Computing - I have hands-on experience creating spatial apps for Apple platforms with ARKit and RealityKit.

## ðŸ§­ Currently Exploring:
- MLX Swift - A swift-native framework designed to light weight Large Language Models directly on Apple devices.
- RealityKit - More advanced capabilities of RealityKit.
- Metal - Writing custom shaders using Metal.

## ðŸ§³ Other Apple frameworks Iâ€™ve tinkered with.
- SwiftUI - A declarative framework to build beautiful, reactive user interfaces across Apple platforms.
- SwiftData - Appleâ€™s lightweight, Swift-native framework for local data persistence and model-driven apps.
- Swift Charts - A flexible framework to create beautiful, animated charts and data visualizations in SwiftUI.
- MapKit - A framework for embedding interactive maps and location-based features into your app.
- HealthKit - A secure framework for managing, sharing, and analyzing health and fitness data across Apple devices.
- SceneKit - A 3D graphics framework for building immersive scenes, animations, and visualizations on Apple platforms.
